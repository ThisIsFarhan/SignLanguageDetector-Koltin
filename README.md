# Hand Sign Language Detection App

A real-time **hand sign language detection Android app** using **MediaPipe** framework. The app runs **entirely on-device**, enabling **fast and efficient classification** of hand signs along with **speech-to-text (STT) functionality** for enhanced accessibility.

## Features
- **Hand Sign Detection:** Utilizes **MediaPipeâ€™s object detection model** fine-tuned on a custom dataset.
- **On-Device Processing:** Runs locally without internet dependency for real-time recognition.
- **CameraX Integration:** Captures hand movements and processes them efficiently.
- **Speech-to-text (STT):** Converts speech to text

## Tech Stack
- **Android (Java/Kotlin)**
- **MediaPipe Framework**
- **CameraX API**
- **Speech-to-text (STT) Engine**

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-sign-detection.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
3. Build and run the application on a physical device or emulator with camera support.

## Usage
1. Point the camera towards a **hand sign gesture**.
2. The app will **detect and classify** the sign in real-time.
3. For the speech-to-text feature, click on the mic to speak and it will be narrated.
